Over-fishing is catching too many fish at once, so the breeding population becomes too depleted to recover. Highly disruptive to the food chain, these isolated, regional depletion became global and catastrophic by the late 20th century. The damage done by over-fishing goes beyond the marine environment. As a result of prolonged and widespread over-fishing, nearly a third of the world's assessed fisheries are now in deep trouble â€” and that's likely an underestimate, since many fisheries remain unstudied.
